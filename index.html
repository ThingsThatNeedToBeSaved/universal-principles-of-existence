                    Awareness is the foundation of all existence. Without
                    awareness, there is no recognition of being, no distinction
                    between presence and absence. Awareness is not just passive
                    noticing but an active condition that allows reality to be
                    experienced and reflected upon. It frames every act of
                    perception, thought, and feeling, serving as the entry point
                    to all further principles.

                <h2>Principle 2: The Universal Cycle</h2>
                <p>
                    Existence does not appear as isolated events. Everything
                    that comes into being is already in relation before it
                    becomes distinct. Relation precedes becoming — without
                    context, nothing can arise. This interdependence provides
                    the clarity needed to understand cycles not as separate
                    acts, but as movements within a larger continuity.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The universal cycle can be observed in four stages. Each
                    stage is not strictly separate but flows into the next,
                    forming a rhythm of existence:
                </p>

                    <li>
                        <strong>Emergence (Beginning):</strong> A new form,
                        thought, or state arises. It never appears from nothing
                        but always emerges from conditions already present.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Continuation (Sustaining):</strong> What has
                        emerged is maintained through energy, attention, or
                        structure. Continuation shows how existence requires
                        balance to endure.

                    <li>
                        <strong>Transformation (Change):</strong> No state
                        remains fixed. Over time, each form alters, adapts, or
                        declines. Transformation prevents stagnation and allows
                        growth.

                        integrated into what will be, making way for new
                        emergence.

                <p>
                    Every form of existence requires a vessel — a structure that
                    holds, channels, or expresses it. A vessel can be material,
                    such as the body; mental, such as a thought system; or
                    collective, such as a culture. The vessel is not secondary
                    to what it carries: its shape, capacity, and durability
                    define the possibilities of what can be expressed. Purpose
                    is therefore not imposed but arises from the relation
                    between vessel and content.

                    Existence does not end with the vessel. For continuity, what
                    has been formed must be transmitted. Transmission ensures
                    that structures, patterns, and functions move across time
                    and relation. This transmission may be genetic, cultural, or
                    informational, but in every case it preserves continuity
                    while allowing adaptation.

                <p>
                    Transmission is not permanent. Every form that is carried
                    forward eventually weakens, alters, or dissolves. Creation
                    arises as the echo of infinity manifesting in time, while
                    decay returns what was created back into openness. These two
                    processes are not opposed but mutually necessary: creation
                    without decay leads to rigidity, while decay without
                    creation leads to emptiness. Together they sustain balance
                    and renewal.

                    Zero does not exist in matter. It is a logical construct of

                    addition, division, multiplication, absence. Zero and
                    infinity are boundaries of thought rather than realities of
                    matter. They expand understanding but also show the creative
                    role of mind in generating concepts beyond what is

                    existence is always expanding, always generating more than
                    logic can capture. Emotion, intuition, and direct awareness
                    reveal aspects of being that logic frames but cannot
                    exhaust. To rely on logic alone is to mistake the map for

                    existence: from awareness to cycles, vessels, transmissions,
                    infinity, and the boundaries of logic. They show that
